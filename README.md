# 201812_Randomized-Algorithms
Project on randomized algorithms for computing the median of a set numbers. Comparison between algorithms in speed and performance.

Randomized algorithms allow to diminish the computational cost when solving some problems. However, as we are not dealing with deterministic algorithms, they may lead to an incorrect answer.
The goal is to describe algorithms that have a negligible expected error, and are much more efficient than the deterministic solution. Here you can see an example of 
3 different algorithms for solving the problem of finding the median of a set of numbers. Moreover you will find a pdf with the whole study and conclusions. Have fun!
